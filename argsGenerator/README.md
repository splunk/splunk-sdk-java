# Args Class Generator

This tool is used to generate custom `Args` subclasses based on the REST API documentation for the associated endpoint.


## Example Usage

```
./gen_args_class.py < specs/JobArgs_POST__search_jobs.argspec > Output.java
```


## Quickstart

For each class that you wish to generate, an `.argspec` file must be created that defines the specific parameters supported by the Args class, along with its Java datatype and documentation.

For example, the specification:

```
auto_cancel
AutoCancel
int
If specified, the job automatically cancels after this many seconds of inactivity. (0 means never auto-cancel)
===
```

...generates the following code:

```
    /* BEGIN AUTOGENERATED CODE */
    
    /**
     * @param autoCancel
     *      If specified, the job automatically cancels after this many seconds of inactivity. (0 means never auto-cancel)
     */
    public void setAutoCancel(int autoCancel) {
        this.put("auto_cancel", autoCancel);
    }
    
    /* END AUTOGENERATED CODE */
```

Notice that the generator does not generate an entire class, but rather only its methods.
The user must manually:

* Create the class definition and documentation.
* Add the constructor.
* Add any nested `enum` types that the generated setters require.


## Argument Specification Format

Any line that begins with `#` is an comment and will be ignored. Blank lines are significant (and are not ignored).

Any line at the beginning of the file that begins with `!` is a directive and will change the behavior of the generator. For example:

```
# Some arguments are defined multiple times by different copied sections.
# Ignore errors related to this. The first version wins.
!SET ignore_duplicates 1
```

The rest of the file is a series of argument definitions:

```
<< machine name >>
<< Java name (upper camelcase) >>
<< Java type >>
<< description line #1 >>
<< description line #2 >>
<< description line .. >>
<< description line #n >>
===
```

Note that the last specification must still end with a `===` line.

### Special Java Types

A few values for `<< Java type >>` are handled specially:

* `String[]-MULTIPLE` - Each value will be a separate parameter.
    * For example "f = {1,2,3}" would appear as `f=1&f=2&f=3` in the final URL.
* `String[]-CSV` - Values will be submitted as a single comma-separated parameter.
    * For example "f = {1,2,3}" would appear as `f=1,2,3` in the final URL.

### Custom Setter Code

For more complex cases where the generated accessor is not appropriate (like the Java type `Date`), you can also specify custom code for an argument by adding a `!CODE` line after the argument description and follow that line with custom Java code.

For example:

```
dispatch.earliest_time
DispatchEarliestTime
Date
A date that specifies the earliest time for this search.
!CODE
        String javaFormatString = "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ";
        String timeString = new SimpleDateFormat(javaFormatString).format(dispatchEarliestTime);
        this.put("dispatch.earliest_time", timeString);
===
```

...generates this code:

```
    /**
     * @param dispatchEarliestTime
     *      A date that specifies the earliest time for this search.
     */
    public void setDispatchEarliestTime(Date dispatchEarliestTime) {
        String javaFormatString = "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ";
        String timeString = new SimpleDateFormat(javaFormatString).format(dispatchEarliestTime);
        this.put("dispatch.earliest_time", timeString);
    }
```
