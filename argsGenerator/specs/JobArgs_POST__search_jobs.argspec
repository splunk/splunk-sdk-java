now
Now
String
Specifies a time string that sets the absolute time used for any relative time specifier in the search. This value defaults to the current system time.<p>You can specify a relative time modifier for this parameter. For example, specify +2d to specify the current time plus two days. If you specify a relative time modifier both in this parameter and in the search string, the search string modifier takes precedence.<p>For information about relative time modifiers, see <a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/SearchReference/SearchTimeModifiers" target="_blank">Time modifiers for search</a> in the Search Reference.
