/*
 * Summary of class relationships and control flow
 *
 * All result readers support both the Iterator interface and
 * getNextEvent method. They share the same underlying implementation
 * of getNextElement(). The iterator interface is supported through
 * the base class, StreamIterableBase (which is also used by
 * multi result readers).
 *
 * Some result readers support multiple result sets in the input stream.
 * A result set can be skipped, or combined with the
 * previous result set with newer events returned through the same
 * iterator used for the older events even through they are in different result
 * sets.
 *
 * Such a result reader is also used by a multi result reader which
 * returns an iterator over the result sets, with one result set returned
 * in one iteration, as SearchResults. SearchResults is an interface consisting
 * of getters of preview flag, field name list, and an iterator over events.
 * Unlike ResultReader, SearchResults does not have a close method. Only the
 * containing multi reader needs to be closed by an application.
