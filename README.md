# The Splunk Software Development Kit for Java
### Version 0.8.0 (Beta Release)

This SDK contains library code and examples designed to enable developers to
build applications using Splunk.

Splunk is a search engine and analytic environment that uses a distributed
map-reduce architecture to efficiently index, search and process large 
time-varying data sets.

The Splunk product is popular with system administrators for aggregation and
monitoring of IT machine data, security, compliance and a wide variety of 
other scenarios that share a requirement to efficiently index, search, analyze
and generate real-time notifications from large volumes of time series data.

The Splunk developer platform enables developers to take advantage of the 
same technology used by the Splunk product to build exciting new applications
that are enabled by Splunk's unique capabilities.

## Getting started with the Splunk Java SDK

The Splunk Java SDK contains library code and examples that show how to 
programmatically interact with Splunk for a variety of scenarios including 
searching, saved searches, data inputs, and many more, along with building 
complete applications. 

The information in this Readme provides steps to get going quickly, but for more
in-depth information be sure to visit the 
[Developer Portal](http://dev.splunk.com/view/java-sdk/SP-CAAAECN). 

### Requirements

Here's what you need to get going with the Splunk Java SDK.

#### Splunk

If you haven't already installed Splunk, download it here: 
http://www.splunk.com/download. For more about installing and running Splunk 
and system requirements, see Installing & Running Splunk 
(http://dev.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAADRV). 

#### Splunk Java SDK

Get the Splunk Java SDK from GitHub (https://github.com/) and clone the 
resources to your computer. For example, use the following command: 

>  git clone https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-java.git

#### Java and Ant

You'll need Java SE version 6 or higher, which you can download from the 
Oracle web site 
(http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). 

You'll also need Ant, which you can install from the Apache website 
(http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi). 

If you are using Windows, you'll need to make sure the following system 
variables are created and set: 

*   ANT_HOME should be set to the location where Ant is installed.

*   JAVA_HOME should be set to the directory where the JDK is installed.

*   PATH should include the path to the %ANT_HOME%\bin directory.

For full installation instructions, you can find more information here:
 
*   Java Platform Installation 
    (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/index-137561.html)

*   Installing Apache Ant 
    (http://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html)

### Building the SDK and documentation

To build the SDK, open a command prompt at the root of the Splunk Java SDK 
repository and enter: 

>  ant

To remove all build artifacts from the repository, enter:

>  ant clean

To build the documentation for the SDK, enter: 

>  ant javadoc

If you are interested in more control of the build process, see the build.xml 
file. You can also type the following command from anywhere in the repository 
and Ant will find the root build file:

>  ant {target} -find

### Examples and unit tests

The Splunk Java SDK includes several examples and unit tests that are run at 
the command line. 


#### Set up the .splunkrc file

To connect to Splunk, many of the SDK examples and unit tests take command-
line arguments that specify values for the host, port, and login credentials 
for Splunk. For convenience during development, you can store these arguments 
as key-value pairs in a text file named .splunkrc. Then, when you don't 
specify these arguments at the command line, the SDK examples and unit tests 
use the values from the .splunkrc file. 

To use a .splunkrc file, create a text file with the following format:

    # Host at which Splunk is reachable (OPTIONAL)
    host=localhost
    # Port at which Splunk is reachable (OPTIONAL)
    # Use the admin port, which is 8089 by default.
    port=8089
    # Splunk username
    username=admin
    # Splunk password
    password=changeme
    # Access scheme (OPTIONAL)
    scheme=https
    # Application context (OPTIONAL)
    app=MyApp
    # Owner context (OPTIONAL)
    owner=User1

Save the file as .splunkrc in the current user's home directory.

*   For example on Mac OS X, save the file as: 

    >  ~/.splunkrc

*   On Windows, save the file as: 

    >  C:\Users\currentusername\\.splunkrc

    You might get errors in Windows when you try to name the file because
    ".splunkrc" looks like a nameless file with an extension. You can use
    the command line to create this file--go to the 
    C:\Users\currentusername directory and enter the following command: 

    >  Notepad.exe .splunkrc

    Click Yes, then continue creating the file.

NOTE: Storing login credentials in the .splunkrc file is only for convenience 
during developmentâ€”this file isn't part of the Splunk platform and 
shouldn't be used for storing user credentials for production. And, if you're 
at all concerned about the security of your credentials, just enter them at 
the command line rather than saving them in the .splunkrc file. 


#### Run examples

After you build the SDK, examples are put in the splunk-sdk-
java/dist/examples directory. To run the examples, run the Java interpreter 
at the command line using the -jar flag to specify the target example jar 
file, and include any arguments that are required by the example. To get help 
for an example, use the --help argument with an example. 

For example, to see the command-line arguments for the Search example, open a 
command prompt in the splunk-sdk-java directory and enter: 

>  java -jar dist/examples/search.jar --help

To run the Search example, open a command prompt in the splunk-sdk-java 
directory and enter: 

>  java -jar dist/examples/search.jar "search * | head 10" --output_mode=csv

There is also a helper script called run in the root of the repository that 
simplifies running the SDK examples. For example, on Mac OS X you could 
simply enter: 

>  ./run search "search * | head 10" --output_mode=csv

#### Run unit tests

To run the SDK unit tests, open a command prompt at the root of the Splunk 
Java SDK repository and enter: 

>  ant test

To run the units from anywhere in the repository, enter:

>  ant test -find

It's also possible to run the units within Java IDEs such as IntelliJ and 
Eclipse. For example, to open the Splunk Java SDK project in Eclipse: 
1.  Click File, Import. 
2.  Click General, Existing Projects into Workspace, then click Next. 
3.  In Select root directory, type the path to the Splunk Java SDK root
    directory (or click Browse to locate it), then click Finish.
