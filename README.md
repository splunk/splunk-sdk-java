# The Splunk Java Software Development Kit

#### Version 1.0

The Splunk Java Software Development Kit (SDK) contains library code and examples designed to enable developers to
build applications using Splunk.

Splunk is a search engine and analytic environment that uses a distributed
map-reduce architecture to efficiently index, search and process large 
time-varying data sets.

The Splunk product is popular with system administrators for aggregation and
monitoring of IT machine data, security, compliance and a wide variety of 
other scenarios that share a requirement to efficiently index, search, analyze
and generate real-time notifications from large volumes of time series data.

The Splunk developer platform enables developers to take advantage of the 
same technology used by the Splunk product to build exciting new applications
that are enabled by Splunk's unique capabilities.


## Getting started with the Splunk Java SDK

The Splunk Java SDK contains library code and examples that show how to 
programmatically interact with Splunk for a variety of scenarios including 
searching, saved searches, data inputs, and many more, along with building 
complete applications. 

The information in this Readme provides steps to get going quickly, but for more
in-depth information be sure to visit the 
[Splunk Developer Portal](http://dev.splunk.com/view/java-sdk/SP-CAAAECN). 

### Requirements

Here's what you need to get going with the Splunk Java SDK.

#### Splunk

If you haven't already installed Splunk, download it [here](http://www.splunk.com/download). 
For more about installing and running Splunk 
and system requirements, see [Installing & Running Splunk](http://dev.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAADRV). 

#### Splunk Java SDK

Get the Splunk Java SDK from [GitHub](https://github.com/) and clone the 
resources to your computer. For example, use the following command: 

    git clone https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-java.git

#### Java and Ant

You'll need Java SE version 6 or higher, which you can download from the 
[Oracle web site](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). 

You'll also need Ant, which you can install from the [Apache website](http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi). 

If you are using Windows, you'll need to make sure the following system 
variables are created and set: 

*   **ANT_HOME** should be set to the location where Ant is installed.

*   **JAVA_HOME** should be set to the directory where the JDK is installed.

*   **PATH** should include the path to the **%ANT_HOME%\bin** directory.

For full installation instructions, you can find more information here:
 
*   [Java Platform Installation](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/index-137561.html)

*   [Installing Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html)

### Building the SDK and documentation

To build the SDK, open a command prompt in the **/splunk-sdk-java** 
directory and enter: 

    ant

or

> ant dist

This builds all the .class files and the jars. If you just want to build
the .class files, you can run

> ant build

To remove all build artifacts from the repository, enter:

    ant clean

To build the documentation for the SDK, enter: 

    ant javadoc

### Examples and unit tests

The Splunk Java SDK includes several examples and unit tests that are run at 
the command line. 

#### Set up the .splunkrc file

To connect to Splunk, many of the SDK examples and unit tests take command-line
arguments that specify values for the host, port, and login credentials for
Splunk. For convenience during development, you can store these arguments as
key-value pairs in a text file named **.splunkrc**. Then, the SDK examples and unit tests
use the values from the **.splunkrc** file when you don't specify them.

To use this convenience file, create a text file with the following format:

    # Splunk host (default: localhost)
    host=localhost
    # Splunk admin port (default: 8089)
    port=8089
    # Splunk username
    username=admin
    # Splunk password
    password=changeme
    # Access scheme (default: https)
    scheme=https
    # Application context
    app=search
    # Owner context
    owner=admin
    # Your version of Splunk (default: 5.0)
    version=5.0

Save the file as **.splunkrc** in the current user's home directory.

*   For example on Mac OS X, save the file as: 

        ~/.splunkrc

*   On Windows, save the file as: 

        C:\Users\currentusername\.splunkrc

    You might get errors in Windows when you try to name the file because
    ".splunkrc" looks like a nameless file with an extension. You can use
    the command line to create this file&mdash;go to the 
    **C:\Users\currentusername** directory and enter the following command: 

        Notepad.exe .splunkrc

    Click **Yes**, then continue creating the file.

**Note**: Storing login credentials in the **.splunkrc** file is only for convenience 
during development. This file isn't part of the Splunk platform and 
shouldn't be used for storing user credentials for production. And, if you're 
at all concerned about the security of your credentials, just enter them at 
the command line rather than saving them in this file. 


#### Run examples

After you build the SDK, examples are put in the **/splunk-sdk-
java/dist/examples** directory. To run the examples, run the Java interpreter 
at the command line using the `-jar` flag to specify the target example jar 
file, and include any arguments that are required by the example. To get help 
for an example, use the `--help` argument with an example. 

For example, to see the command-line arguments for the Search example, open a 
command prompt in the **/splunk-sdk-java** directory and enter: 

    java -jar dist/examples/search.jar --help

To run the Search example, open a command prompt in the **/splunk-sdk-java**
directory and enter: 

    java -jar dist/examples/search.jar "search * | head 10" --output_mode=csv

There is also a helper script called run in the root of the repository that 
simplifies running the SDK examples. For example, on Mac OS X you could 
simply enter: 

    ./run search "search * | head 10" --output_mode=csv

All the the example jars are completely self contained. They can be used
completely independently of the SDK's repository.

#### Run unit tests

To run the SDK unit tests, open a command prompt in the **/splunk-sdk-java** 
directory and enter: 

    ant test

To run the units from anywhere in the repository, enter:

    ant test -find

It's also possible to run the units within Java IDEs such as IntelliJ and 
Eclipse. For example, to open the Splunk Java SDK project in Eclipse: 

  1. Click **File**, **Import**. 
  2. Click **General**, **Existing Projects into Workspace**, then click **Next**. 
  3. In **Select root directory**, type the path to the Splunk Java SDK root
     directory (or click **Browse** to locate it), then click **Finish**.

#### Measure code coverage

To measure the code coverage of the test suite, open a 
command prompt in the **/splunk-sdk-java** directory and enter:

    ant coverage

To run code coverage from anywhere in the repository, enter:

    ant coverage -find

To view the coverage report, open **/splunk-sdk-java/build/reports/coverage/index.html** 
in your web browser.
